## General workflow

For each deployment
- load in HMD data
- summarize to hourly HMD
- summarize to percentiles

```{r Load_libraries}
library(here)
library(PAMscapes)
library(PAMmisc)
library(tcltk2) # handles interactively navigating to network file paths
library(tidyverse)
library(tictoc) # allows for time tracking of longer processes
library(svDialogs) # allows for some interactive inputs
source("AMP_pkgs_funs.R")
```

# Load hybrid millidecade data

The function that handles all the data loading (regardless of format!)
is `checkSoundscapeInput`. You can give this a single file or multiple
files and it will load them up.

```{r Load HMD}


# List all deployment names in given directory

# Since server folders are in a standard structure, use parent folder to get list of all deployments
dep_names <- list.dirs("/home/jmccordic/PassiveAcoustics/DETECTOR_OUTPUT/PYTHON_SOUNDSCAPE_PYPAM/Raw/NEFSC_GOM/", recursive = FALSE)


# ask user which site to run
site_name <- dlg_input(message = "Site name (e.g., 'MONHEGAN')")$res

# select the deployment(s) to load in
dep_list <- as.list(dep_names[which(grepl(site_name, dep_names))])


# Navigate to directory & list netCDF files with HMD data

# set path for directory with netCDF files
# Could maybe set this up as a list for AMP deployments
# could have c("dep1","dep2","dep3") and then use map function 
# for setting directory & running checkSoundscapeInput

# deployment_id <- "PARKSAUSTRALIA_TWOROCKS_202105_TRW"

nc_folder_list <- dep_list |>
  map(~paste0({.}, "/NC")) |>
  unlist()


tic()
hmd_all <- loadMultiscapeData(nc_folder_list, 
                              timeBin = "1hour",
                              binFunction = "median",
                              binCount = TRUE,
                              )
toc()

# loading in 8 deployments took ~37 MINUTES on R container...
# -- might be faster to load individually and stitch together in a separate step?

# hmd_hr <- hmd_all |>
#   # remove HMD values < 10 Hz for better viz
#     select(-c(HMD_0:HMD_9))

# 
#   ncFolder <- paste0(dep_name, "/NC")
#   ncFiles <- list.files(ncFolder, pattern='nc$', full.names=TRUE)
#   
#   tic()
#   hmd_data_hr <- loadSoundscapeData(ncFiles) |>
#     # remove HMD values < 10 Hz for better viz
#     select(-c(HMD_0:HMD_9))|> 
#     # summarize into 1 hour bins
#     binSoundscapeData(bin = "1hour", 
#                       method = "median",
#                       binCount = TRUE) |>
#     # add deployment ID to data
#     mutate(Dep_ID = deployment_id)
#   toc()
  
  write_csv(hmd_all, 
            file = paste0("/home/jmccordic/Jessica.Mccordic/Github/AMP_NPZ_Soundscapes/data/NEFSC_GOM_",site_name, "_HMD_hourlymed.csv"))
